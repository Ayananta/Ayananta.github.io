# How to Make a Bed
Making your bed is not only about making your bed, but it is about taking the first step in setting an order for the various other tasks that lay ahead in the day. 

If you make your bed, you get a sense of satisfaction from the first task you completed in the day. This satisfaction can lead to having a calm and happy mind and provide the necessary impetus to complete the next task of the day, the next, and the next. At the end of the day that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed. And, if by chance, you have a miserable day, you will come home to a bed that is made. And, a made-bed lends you hope that the next day can be better. 

Besides the subliminal benefit, a made-bed makes your room look tidy and organized, too.

## Making Your Bed
It is not that difficult to make your bed. 

**To make your bed**

 1. Start from scratch by taking off all the sheets, pillows, or any other items you may have on your bed.
 2. Dust down the mattress.
 3. Take the bedsheet and spread it over the mattress.
 4. Tuck the corners deep and tight, and then tuck the bedsheet tightly along the entire line of the bed.
 5. Down down the bedsheet to remove any accumulated dust from the previous day.
 6. Lastly, place the pillows neatly beside one another.

You are done. :)
